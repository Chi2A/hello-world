I do not have a lot of tech experience. But I can assume you that I have lots of desire to learn and succeed.I am ready to commute to the learning process,deadlines and much more.
I'm sure that joining **Code Louisville** is a pathway to happiness through learning valuable skills, building a supportive community, and positioning myself for success in the exciting world of coding and technology.
Can't wait to meet instructors and my  teammates.
